Goldsky is foundational data infrastructure for applications that need real-time blockchain data, right in their own infrastructure.

Goldsky, in a nutshell, provides:

**Subgraphs**:  
Enterprise-grade Subgraph indexing with extra capabilities like webhooks and more.

**Mirror**:  
A data pipeline platform that allows you to get real-time, re-org aware tables in your database or message queues with a single yaml config.

Subgraphs and Mirror can be used together or separately. Mirror can use Goldsky-hosted subgraphs as a data source, allowing you to get your data into any of our sinks without any data lag.

## Quick start

To get started with Goldsky:

1. Create an account at [app.goldsky.com](https://app.goldsky.com "target=hello").
2. Choose a plan that best fits your needs.
3. Create an API key on the [Settings page](https://app.goldsky.com/dashboard/settings).
4. Install the Goldsky CLI:
   ```shell
   npm install -g @goldskycom/cli
   ```
5. Log in with the API key created earlier:
   ```shell
   goldsky login
   ```
6. Deploy your subgraph
   ```shell
   cd <your-subgraph-directory>
   graph build # Build your subgraph as normal.
   goldsky subgraph deploy my-subgraph/1.0.0
   ```
   Alternatively, if you have public subgraphs deployed to **The Graphâ€™s hosted service**, the following command seamlessly migrates your subgraph to Goldsky:
   ```shell
   goldsky subgraph deploy your-subgraph-name/your-version --from-url <your-subgraph-query-url>
   ```
   [Learn more](/migrate-from-the-graph) about migrating from The Graph.
7. Access data
   ```shell
   goldsky subgraph list
   ```
   Open the "GraphQL API" link in your browser to access your data
