title: Migrate from The Graph
description: Migrate your subgraphs from The Graph and host them on Goldsky
---

Goldsky provides a one-step migration for your subgraphs on The Graph's hosted service or decentralized network.

Migrate today to ensure continued service availability for your business and set yourself up to leverage [Fusion](/fusion) and [Mirror](/mirror) to integrate blockchain data into your systems.

This is a drop-in replacement with the following benefits:

- ✅ The same subgraph API that your apps already use
- ✅ A load-balanced network of third-party and on-prem RPC nodes to improve performance and reliability
- ✅ Tagging and versioning for hot-swapping subgraphs, allowing for seamless updates
- ✅ Alerts and auto-recovery in case of subgraph data consistency issues due to corruption from re-orgs or other issues
- ✅ A world-class team who monitors your subgraphs 24/7

## Migrate subgraphs to Goldsky

Please follow the [quick start](/#quick-start) instructions to set up your account and install the Goldsky CLI.

If you have subgraphs deployed to The Graph’s hosted service, the following command seamlessly migrates your subgraph to Goldsky:

```bash
goldsky subgraph deploy your-subgraph-name/your-version --from-url <your-subgraph-query-url>
```

If you have subgraphs deployed to The Graph's decentralized network, use the IPFS hash instead (visible on The Graph's Explorer page for the specified subgraph):

```bash
goldsky subgraph deploy your-subgraph-name/your-version --from-ipfs-hash <your-subgraph-ipfs-hash>
```

### Monitor indexing progress

Once you started the migration with the above command, you can monitor your subgraph's indexing status with:

```bash
goldsky subgraph list
```

Alternatively, navigate to [app.goldsky.com](https://app.goldsky.com) to see your subgraphs, their indexing progress, and more.

## Dedicated subgraph indexing

To ensure industry-leading reliability and latency, we can provision independent infrastructure for individual enterprise customers.
