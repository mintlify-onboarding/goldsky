Give your users blazing-fast auto-complete suggestions, full-text fuzzy searches, and scored recommendations based off of on-chain data.

Elasticsearch is the leading search datastore, used for a wide variety of usecase for billions of datapoints a day, including search, roll-up aggregations, and ultra-fast lookups on text data.

Goldsky supports real-time insertion into Elasticsearch, with event data updating in Elasticsearch indexes as soon as it gets finalized on-chain.

See the [Elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/elasticsearch-intro.html) to see more of what it can do!
