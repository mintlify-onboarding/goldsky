## Overview

Rockset is a real-time analytical database that allows you to query data in real-time, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Rockset can easily scale to terabytes of data - and it's easy to use through REST APIs or SQL.

Rockset is unique through their Converged Index - they index data in multiple different ways, allowing for blazing fast queries across many different types of workloads.

Goldsky has partnered with Rockset to provide teams with real-time data access for on-chain data, using a database powerful enough for time series analytical queries and fast enough for transactional workloads like APIs, while being efficient enough for warehouse-style queries.

Goldsky supports real-time sync into Rockset, with data updating in Rockset indexes. New blockchain transactions and events are queryable within seconds of the block being proposed.

### What you can do with Rockset

- Sync the logs, traces, transactions, and blocks of a whole blockchain and query it
- Sync multiple subgraphs across different chains into one single collection for querying
- Provide APIs on top of SQL Queries through Rockset Query Lambdas
- Power complex dashboards without thinking at all about caching or data freshness
- Build a data warehouse on top of blockchain data

### When to use Rockset over other options

- Your team needs a single database to power both APIs and Dashboards
- You have data that surpasses the limits of a traditional relational database
- You don't want to think about indexes at all
