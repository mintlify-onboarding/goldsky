Mirror is a serverless data pipeline platform that allows you to get real-time data into your database with one yaml definition file.

Data is **pushed** to your datastore or queue, like a representation of blockchain you can query with your other data, with no external rate limits.

A Mirror pipeline instructs Goldsky where to take data from (**sources**), how to _optionally_ process that data (**transforms**), and where to persist the results (**sinks**).

A pipeline:

- is reorg-aware and updates your datastores with the latest information
- runs backfills & data live streaming fully managed by Goldsky so you can focus on your business
- benefits from quality checks and receives automated dataset should there be fixes or improvements
- works with data across chains without worrying about harmonizing data, making sure timestamps + order of events line up, etc.

Each pipeline is defined with a [YAML definition](/mirror/references/pipeline-configuration) that looks like this:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: ethereum.decoded_logs
    version: 1.0.0
    type: dataset
    startAt: latest

transforms:
  - sql: |
      SELECT
          id,
          address,
          event_signature,
          event_params,
          raw_log.block_number as block_number,
          raw_log.block_hash as block_hash,
          raw_log.transaction_hash as transaction_hash
      FROM
          ethereum.decoded_logs
    name: logs
    type: sql
    primaryKey: id

sinks:
  - type: postgres
    table: eth_logs
    schema: goldsky
    secretName: A_POSTGRESQL_SECRET
    sourceStreamName: logs
```

After setting up a [secret](/mirror/sinks/postgresql#secrets), you start a pipeline with:

`goldsky pipeline create edge-logs --definition-path <path_to_file>`
