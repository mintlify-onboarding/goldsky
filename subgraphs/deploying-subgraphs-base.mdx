title: Deploying Subgraphs on Base
description: Step by step instructions to the most common ways to deploy your subgraphs
---

After you've followed the setup instructions in our [Getting Started guide](/), you can use the Instant Subgraph instructions on this page to index a contract address.

For this example we'll use the [BaseGenesisNFT](https://basescan.org/address/0x1fc10ef15e041c5d3c54042e52eb0c54cb9b710c) contract `0x1fc10ef15e041c5d3c54042e52eb0c54cb9b710c`.

1. Copy the contract ABI from the "Contract ABI" section on [the contract's basescan.org page](https://basescan.org/address/0x1fc10ef15e041c5d3c54042e52eb0c54cb9b710c#code) to a `base-genesis-nft-abi.json` file locally.
   - **Note**: Make sure you use the copy icon and not the "Export ABI" option.
1. Create an Instant Subgraph configuration file called `base-genesis-nft.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1",
     "name": "BaseGenesisNFT",
     "abis": {
       "BaseGenesisNFT": {
         "path": "./base-genesis-nft-abi.json"
       }
     },
     "chains": ["base"],
     "instances": [
       {
         "abi": "BaseGenesisNFT",
         "address": "0x1fc10ef15e041c5d3c54042e52eb0c54cb9b710c",
         "startBlock": 0,
         "chain": "base"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
1. Start indexing subgraphs with:
   ```shell
   goldsky subgraph deploy base-genesis-nft/1.0.0 --from-abi ./base-genesis-nft.json
   ```

You can [learn more about Instant Subgraphs](/subgraphs/instant-subgraphs) and how to configure them in our docs.

To find the GraphQL query URL, run the following command:

```shell
goldsky subgraph list base-genesis-nft-base/1.0.0
```

**Note**: Notice how the name ends with `-base`. That was added automatically to indicate we are dealing with an Instant Subgraph on Base.
